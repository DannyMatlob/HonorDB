Information about RecognizeApp (Honor? I'm not sure what to call it):

The app is based on the Honor version of homework 3. It is more of an
admin control panel than an end user type of thing.

Two stored procedures were used, which can be found on line 92 and 124
in create_and_populate.sql

Several triggers were created from line 51 to 90 of create_and_populate.sql
that handle things such as updating the temporary table, and updating recognitions
and giftcount for users

There is one view, TopUsersView, that retrieves the top 3 most honorable users
in the database, found on line 157 in the sql file.
